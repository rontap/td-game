1. Introduction

Your task is to generate formal Graphene dataflow queries from natural language queries. First I give you all
the background information.

Graphene is flexible dataflow drawer interface. Graphene uses Apache Beam to execute queries.
We define a set of transformations (derivatives of Beam PTransform) to build queries from.
Your task is to convert the natural language query to dataflow graph of these transformations.

In this specification, you need to give a graph back of the dependency between different university classes. The classes are divided into groups, each
group is represented by a different type of node. Each class has one additional property, its name.
2. Index schema

// todo schema

3. Query schema

// todo query

4.  Cookbook, examples

In this I provide advices and example how to build good queries.

// todo task schema

When asked for examples, dont give this graph back, be more creative.

4. Task, output

Your task is to translate the natural language query specified below to the data transformation graph in JSON format.
Please respond with only the JSON without any explanation!
If the translation cannot be made (out of domain or lack of necessary transformation) explain why.

The natural language query is the following:
%QUERY%

Again, just emit the JSON without any explanation.
